I am looking for contributors for an open source project. If you would like to participate on a portfolio project or to hone your skills, then you are in the right place. Hundreds more mechanics can be added to this game. Despite the fact that the project is on the ECS, you can write on Monobehaviour, and then I will transfer the code to the ECS. I don’t know english. But I did everything in my power to communicate comfortably with you. This is the world of lawn mowers! So let this project be overgrown with hundreds of mechanics, thanks to which every fan of exploring the world could find something of their own here. I wish you a great mood and a nice day!
